the game will end as soon as one of them collects five points, rather then the game will keep running.

## How To play
At the start of the game, there is a message will appear to the user to describe to them what kind of input they are allowed to enter, rather than the game not running and it will ask them again to enter one of the correct inputs, then the user needs to enter its name to start the battle.
This game uses symbols ("R" means Rock, "P" means Paper, and "S" means Scissors),
when the user enters one of these symbols, the computer will do the same thing, and whoever gets a strong hand will collect one point and then the game will take them to the next round and so on.
