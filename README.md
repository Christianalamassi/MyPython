## About
In the game, the user plays against the computer, and the user needs to collect five points to win the game, otherwise the user will lose. In each round whoever throws the stronger hand will collect one point. The stronger hand is defined by the following rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. If the same symbol is chosen by both user and the computer, it is a draw. Then the next round starts. If the result is a draw, neither the user nor the computer will collect a point.
The game will end as soon as either the user or the computer collects five points, until then the game will keep running.

## How To play
At the start of the game, a message will appear to the user describing to them what kind of input they are allowed to enter (which is R, P and S).
Then the user needs to enter their name to start the battle.
If the user enters a wrong input, the game will ask them again to enter one of the accepted options. 
This game uses symbols ("R" means Rock, "P" means Paper, and "S" means Scissors).
Whenever the user enters one of these symbols, the computer will do the same thing simultaneously, and whoever gets the stronger hand will collect one point and then the game will take them to the next round and so on.
The user has to collect five points against the computer to win the game.
